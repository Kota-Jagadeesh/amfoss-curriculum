# DOM assignment :
## Firstly `DOM` stands for Document Object Model
So, DOM is a programming interface that represents the structure of the web page and this is used to change the pages's style , structure and content in the page .

---

- Dom represents the document as a logical tree of objects and content
- here each part of the branch ends in a node and each node further have another branch again.
- this DOM method allows programmatic access to the tree
- we can use DOM method to change the documents structure and style
- So, this is how the DOM works ...

`DOM also helps the scripting languages like javascript to interact with the webpage`s

---

There are 3 types in DOM :
- CORE DOM this is the standard Model for any structured  document 
- XML DOM this is the standard Model for XML documents
- HTML DOM and this is the model for  HTML documents 

here i'll list some of the DOM methods what i have learnt

1) **getElementId()** - this is used to get the elements with id  mean to work with the elements in javascript which should be applied only for the requred "id" elements and here it access the first element with the specified id 
2) **getElementsByTagName()** - this method allows us to search all the elements with the specified tagname in our page.
3) **getElementByClassName()** - this returns the collection of all the elements that has the class name as specified in the function
4) **querySelectorAll()** - this returns the list of the elements that matches a specified group of selectors
5) **querySelector()** - this method returns the element that matches with the specified css selector
